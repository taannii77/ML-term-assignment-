REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH USING IMAGE CAPTIONING

The objective is to create a reverse image search system employing image captioning using PyTorch and Transformer, enhancing accuracy and relevance. Utilizing the Fashion Product Images Dataset, the model learns intricate associations between images and textual descriptions. The core of the system is a Transformer-based image captioning architecture, generating captions for images to facilitate contextually aware image searches. Integration with the DuckDuckGo API enables fetching similar images based on these captions. The approach involves developing an image captioning model using PyTorch and Transformer, with a focus on transfer learning for robust feature learning. Optimization efforts result in a validation loss of 1.133 and a validation perplexity of 3.105, indicating high accuracy and reliability. The key tools include PyTorch, Transformer libraries, and API integration tools for DuckDuckGo. Visualizations of image-caption pairs and search results are provided for reference.
