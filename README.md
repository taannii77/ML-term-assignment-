REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH USING IMAGE CAPTIONING


GOAL
To develop a reverse image search system using image captioning with PyTorch and Transformer, enhancing search accuracy and relevance.

DATASET
The Fashion Product Images Dataset, comprising diverse images and their captions, facilitates the model to learn complex associations between visual content and textual descriptions.

DESCRIPTION
This project employs a Transformer-based architecture for an image captioning model, which acts as the core of the reverse image search system. By generating captions for images, the system achieves a more contextually aware image search, leveraging the DuckDuckGo API for fetching similar images based on these captions.

PROCEDURE
Developed an Image Captioning model using PyTorch and Transformer, focusing on transfer learning for robust feature learning.
Utilized the DuckDuckGo API for reverse image searching using the generated captions.
Optimized the model to achieve a validation loss of 1.133 and a validation perplexity of 3.105, indicating high accuracy and reliability.
MODELS USED
PyTorch for model development and training.
Transformer model for the image encoder-text decoder architecture.
LIBRARIES NEEDED
PyTorch
Transformer libraries
API integration tools for DuckDuckGo (FastAI)
VISUALIZATION
Visualizations of the image-caption pairs and search results are provided in the accompanying Images folder.
